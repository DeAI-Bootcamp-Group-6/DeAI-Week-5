# DeAI-Week-5

## Weekend Project
To consolidate the knowledge acquired this week, students should complete the following project:

Create a GitHub repository for your project
Add all members of your group as collaborators
Create a README.md file with the description of your project
Create a new application from scratch using NextJS
Create a page with a single input field for the user to upload an image
Ideally, the user would upload a picture of an animal
Add a button to upload the image
Use a Computer Vision model to detect and classify the animal
The model should be able to detect at least 10 different animals of your choice
The model should return the name of the animal detected (classification)
Create an AI Agent that can find a page in Wikipedia with the name of the animal, retrieve the description, and determine if the animal is dangerous
If the uploaded image contains an animal, pass the image to the AI Agent and await the answer
Display the answer on the page, indicating whether the animal in the picture is dangerous
Submit your project in the submission form
